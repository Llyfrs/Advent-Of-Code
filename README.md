# Advent-Of-Code
My solutions for Advent of Code 

## Rules for my self on how I will approach this event 

1. Every solution will have 2 files one for each part (to organize)
2. The code will be the way it was when I finished the puzzle. 
3. Ideally completing every year fully in only one language. 

# 2021
I wil be finishing all my solution in 2021 in Haskell. Since I learned it recently and I want to test my skills. If I find module that can help me I will use it but I will probably mostly default functions.
