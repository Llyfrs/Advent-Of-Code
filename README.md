# Advent-Of-Code
My solutions for Advent of Code 

# 2021
I wil be finishing all my solution in 2021 in **Haskell**. Since I learned it recently and I want to test my skills. If I find module that can help me I will use it but I will probably mostly default functions. 

# 2022 
This year I will do in **Rust**, since I want to learn it and this is great way to practice it.
